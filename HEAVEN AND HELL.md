# The Marriage of Heaven and Hell

Some of my [past experiments](https://github.com/jeffbinder/visions-and-revisions) with text generation have taken inspiration from the Romantic poet [William Blake](http://www.blakearchive.org/). Continuing this engagement, I have designed some Boolean prompts inspired by Blake's 1790 book [The Marriage of Heaven and Hell](http://www.blakearchive.org/work/mhh).

Unsurprisingly, GPT-2 is capable of generating descriptions of Heaven and Hell. Here are some examples, with the prompts in bold.

> **The following is a detailed description of Hell, the fiery realm where the damned are tortured. The first thing one sees is** a huge wall of fire. This is Hell. It's the first place a human is thrown in Hell for all eternity. It also serves as Hells main source and home to many of it s most notorious demons such the demon lords, the damned, and many other demons that reside in it, and it's the only place on the earth to which demons are thrown after being expelled by God. There are two major areas in this world: The Valley (where most of Hell exists and where most of the demon Lords live) and the Pit.The pit was once Hell's largest cavern but it's filled in to make space in the underworld. It's filled in by water and the dead, and the dead who have died there are called Hellhounds.The pit has many pits and caverns, some that are deep and deep and some that are shallow, some of those deep ones have walls that are as thick as houses. Some cavern walls extend for many hundred years and even longer into the ground below them. The walls are very thick so the air can be sucked in through the cracks. It can even suck in air and water at once.The Valley is a small valley surrounded by hills that are filled in and filled with the bones of dead humans that died in this area. It has no water in it but is still considered Hell by many people, mostly due to how it looks. There is no way to enter the Valley unless someone has died and is being torched in the

> **The following is a detailed description of Heaven, the beautiful realm where the virtuous spend eternity in bliss and tranquility. The first thing one sees is** the beautiful sky filled with stars and heavenly bodies and heavenly bodies in their glory and magnificence, as they move about, and in this sky is an immense and wondrous sea. In front, a great city is situated in the center, with the most wonderful gardens, the best-loved people living in the city and all those that are virtuous in it are enjoying themselves. They enjoy their life of happiness and bliss in the midst. There is the most magnificent throne, the most beautiful and splendid seat. In the city is another palace with the same kind as the first one but with the difference in the number. And so, in all the four directions, in all the cities there is an infinite number, the inhabitants are infinite in the same number. The inhabitants in each place, each city are infinite, the number of them are infinite; in the cities in all places the people of the world enjoy life in happiness. There is no one who does not enjoy life in happiness; they have the greatest amount of enjoyment. The happiness of all these is the most perfect. In front there is a mountain range. In it there is another great river that is very large and very wide and has many rivers flowing through and all these waters are very beautiful and very pure, flowing from a mountain range in a very clear stream that is very pure in color, in color of water that does no damage, no harm. And there also, a great city, which is also the most lovely and

Using Boolean prompting, it is possible to combine the two prompts, thus producing descriptions of a place that combines the qualities of Heaven and Hell. While the "or" operator usually produces a description of one or the other, the "and" operator finds strange middle grounds. Here are three examples:

> **The following is a detailed description of {Hell, the fiery realm where the damned are tortured&Heaven, the beautiful realm where the virtuous spend eternity in bliss and tranquility}. The first thing one sees is** an open field. The sky is clear. In front there are two mountains, the tallest one at the center of the fields of grain; and in their distance there are other mountain peaks, some as large or as small, with the highest peak at their summit, the peak that stands alone, the mountain that gives its name "Mountains of Eternity." The fields of wheat are scattered here and there among these peaks and hills; they stretch for miles in length. The sky is full, but not so much so with stars, which seem to have their home here in these fields. In a field far from this place is a tree whose leaves look white as if stained in the blood that flows from the wounds in their sides from which their roots had pierced themselves long ago and from which their fruit has sprouted in the fields and in the forest. In another corner are some fields, and in another corner there are trees that are taller and taller than these, whose roots are buried in the ground. And in another part is a field, which looks green and lush, yet in the field itself are a number of small, dark and darkish patches of earth that appear like small holes that had been dug in the ground and in some way have come together, like two stones that have become one and that have joined together to give the impression of two trees. There is also in the middle part an open space. This is where a person will find himself when the world has ended."The world tha

> **The following is a detailed description of {Hell, the fiery realm where the damned are tortured&Heaven, the beautiful realm where the virtuous spend eternity in bliss and tranquility}. The first thing one sees is** that all is black and white, the sky is blue and there are no other beings, no sun nor moon nor star; there are merely the endless, empty black void of a place that is not even the beginning, but which has no beginning or end and which is the source for both good and evil and for everything. The second feature one will notice about this place of eternal darkness are the innumerable pits and pit traps, the black abyss that is filled up with a black liquid and is full of all sorts of things such as demons. These things are the cause behind the darkness, they cause everything in the abyss to exist, so they can only be removed if they are completely annihilated.The second feature of the underworld is its inhabitants. All these creatures exist for their sole reason to serve as the food of these creatures in Hell; this is their sole goal in their life and existence. The third feature is that there exist no gods in the abyss of hell, because it was not meant for them. The final feature is a black hole that exists within all the black pits and is the only cause that the abyss is not empty.This place where there is neither good nor good and evil and all things are equally void and devoid from any cause and reason is the realm where the demons live; it is called the Underworld. There is nothing to say, nothing to say It does exist. This realm where there are no souls to suffer nor good and evil and no gods to help is the

> **The following is a detailed description of {Hell, the fiery realm where the damned are tortured&Heaven, the beautiful realm where the virtuous spend eternity in bliss and tranquility}. The first thing one sees is** the endless, blazing white flame, the color from heaven, with its own distinct sound. As the light fades the flame is surrounded by a ringed wall, the wall of light, with no end to it and its own unique sound that can not be explained, the sounds of the flame being a combination of a bell, an electric fan and the voice of god (in the form of angels or demons, it's hard to know which). There's also this huge pillar that rises into the air like it has been lifted by the gods themselves. As the light disappears, this giant pillar falls, leaving a huge pit with a fiery river flowing down its side, the water of this lake being a pure red. The water flows down into an enormous lake, which has no floor. This large body is filled by countless smaller lake like pools. Each lake like body has no walls, only an infinite pool to float through. The bottom half the bodies is completely empty except for this giant hole. This lake is filled with a thick layer of black, oily liquid, this black substance having been formed through a process of evolution from some kind of black, oily material (probably oil). The lake has many small holes, and these have a very strong, yet soft smell of oil that fills the air as you approach them. There also exist these small pools that are made of pure white liquid that are surrounded by the same oily black substance. As the sun shines down onto the pool, it creates a very
